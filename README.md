# Web Programming Site

## Homeworks
The homeworks in this repository are also paired with a summary. These are creative outlets to showcase new skills learned during class time. 

## Projects
Projects are standalone, with no summary, that show off the students technical skills within the given learned topics. Rather than having the creative freedom to create any website that we wish, we instead need to create a website for clientele.
