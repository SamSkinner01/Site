        <p>
            The object of Ultimate Frisbee is to gain points by scoring goals. The disc may only be passed, and a goal is scored when a player successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the end zone which that team is attacking. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

        <p>
            In 1968 Joel Silver introduced his idea of Ultimate Frisbee to the Columbia High School student council in Maplewood New Jersey, USA. The next year, the first game was played between two groups of students. They used a Wham-O Master disc. In 1969 a team had been formed at the school and they played in a parking lot.
