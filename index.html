                Thank you so much for visiting this website! I hope you enjoy your stay!
                This website is a collection of all my personal works during the Web
                Programming class. This will contain homeworks and projects for the most part.
                Homeworks are completed purely based upon my curiosity, as long as I use material
                that was previously learned in class. Homeworks have the assignment website itself along with
                a summary describing the topics that were learned in class! Projects are way stricter, however,
                but those will also be accessible on this page! Lastly, there will be an About Me! section 
                at the end of this. Regardless, enjoy your stay!

                Wow! You made it to the bottom of this webpage! Thank you so much for exploring
                the different interesting websites that live here! A little bit about me though, I 
                am a computer science student, currently a junior in college, who is probably
                having too much fun with this! I would like to focus in artificial intelligence, 
                although I think having a general skill in most fields is beneficial. I am initially 
                from Connecticut, but, for now, the city is where I want to stay. That is about it!
                Enjoy the rest of your time on this webpage and in your day! :)
